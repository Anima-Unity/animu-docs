# Getting Started with Anima Unity

Welcome to the Anima Unity Developer Documentation! This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get started with the project and set up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into development, make sure you have the following tools and knowledge:

- **Programming Languages**: Knowledge of **JavaScript** (Node.js) or **Python** and/or **Rust** for backend services, **React** or **Vue.js** for frontend development, **Kotlin** or **Swift** for mobile.
- **Database**: Familiarity with **SQL** or **NoSQL** databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- **Version Control**: Understanding of **Git** and experience with version control systems like GitHub or GitLab.
- **API Integration**: Experience working with **RESTful APIs**.
- **Docker**: Basic understanding of **Docker** for local environment setup and containerization (optional but recommended).

## Clone the Repository

The first step to contributing to Anima Unity is cloning the project repository.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anima-unity/repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd anima-unity
   ```
   
## Install Dependencies

Anima Unity uses Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js (v16.x or above) if you haven't already:
Download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en).

2. Install project dependencies:

```npm install```

This will install both the backend and frontend dependencies listed in the ```package.json``` file.

3. If you're using Docker, you can build and run the project in a containerized environment. Make sure Docker is installed on your machine, and run the following command:

```docker-compose up --build```

## Set Up Environment Variables

Anima Unity requires some environment variables to be set up for local development. These variables define things like API keys, database connections, and other configuration settings.

1. Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory of the project:

```cp .env.example```

2. Open the ```.env``` file and update the values with your local environment configuration:

```DATABASE_URL``` - Database connection string (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

```API_KEY``` - Your API key for third-party services.

```JWT_SECRET``` - A secret key for JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Other necessary environment variables based on your local setup.

## Run the Project Locally

Once everything is set up, you're ready to run the project locally.

1. Start the development server:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers, and you can visit the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Explore the Codebase
Here are some key directories and files you should know about as you start working with Anima Unity:

```/src```: Main source code for the project, including frontend and backend services.

```/frontend```: React-based frontend application.

```/backend```: Node.js backend services (API, authentication, data handling).

```/docs```: Documentation files for the project.

## Test the API
To make sure your local development setup is working, test the API endpoints using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

1. The API documentation is available in the [API Documentation](/) Anima Unity.


2. Start by testing basic GET requests, such as retrieving a list of pets or user profiles.


3. Make sure to check authentication methods (e.g., JWT) when testing protected routes.

## Contributing to Anima Unity

If you'd like to contribute to the Anima Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository: Create your own fork of the repository.


2. Create a feature branch: Use the following command to create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash copy
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```


3. Make changes: Implement the feature or fix the issue you're working on.


4. Commit your changes: Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.

```bash copy
git commit -m "Description of the changes"
```


5. Push your changes: Push your branch to your fork:

```bash copy
git push origin feature/your-feature
```


6. Create a Pull Request: Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues during setup or development, here are some tips:

Double-check your environment variables and make sure they are correctly set.

Ensure you have all dependencies installed by running
```bash copy
npm install
```
again.

Check the Docker configuration if you're using containers and make sure the environment is set up properly.

Look for common issues in the repositoryâ€™s [Issues](#) section for solutions.
