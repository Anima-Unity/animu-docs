# Anima Unity Platform

**Digital ecosystem for animal welfare transformation across Indonesia and Southeast Asia**

> *"Tidak ada hewan yang dibiarkan tertinggal" - No animal left behind*

---

## Executive Summary

Anima Unity represents a comprehensive digital transformation initiative for animal welfare operations across Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Our integrated platform combines advanced technology with community-driven solutions to address critical challenges in animal rescue, healthcare, adoption, and welfare management.

The platform delivers measurable impact through seven core modules: digital identity management (AnimaID), emergency rescue coordination (AnimaVoice), intelligent adoption matching (AdoptHub), transparent donation management (PawHelp), telemedicine services (AnimaClinic), real-time tracking systems (AnimaTrack), and community engagement tools (Community Hub).

## Implementation Roadmap

<Steps>

### Partner Registration & Onboarding
Register as a developer partner at [developer.animaunity.id](https://developer.animaunity.id) and select your organization category:

- **Shelter Partner**: Animal shelters and rescue organizations
- **Veterinary Partner**: Veterinary clinics and healthcare providers  
- **Technology Partner**: Software developers and system integrators
- **Community Partner**: Animal welfare activists and volunteer organizations
- **Government Partner**: Municipal and regulatory agencies

### API Credentials & Environment Setup
Generate secure API credentials for your chosen environment:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.animaunity.id/v1/developers/credentials \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "applicationName": "Animal Welfare Management System",
    "organizationType": "SHELTER_PARTNER",
    "permissions": [
      "read:animals", 
      "write:rescue_reports", 
      "read:donations",
      "write:medical_records"
    ],
    "environment": "production",
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-domain.com/anima-unity-webhooks"
  }'
```

### SDK Installation & Configuration
Install the official Anima Unity SDK for your development environment:

```bash
# Node.js/JavaScript
npm install @animaunity/sdk

# Python
pip install animaunity-python-sdk

# Java/Kotlin
implementation 'com.animaunity:animaunity-sdk:2.1.0'

# PHP
composer require animaunity/php-sdk

# Go
go get github.com/animaunity/go-sdk
```

### Client Initialization & Authentication
Initialize the SDK client with your credentials and preferred configuration:

```kotlin
import com.animaunity.sdk.AnimaUnitySDK

val animaUnityClient = AnimaUnitySDK.builder()
    .apiKey(System.getenv("ANIMA_UNITY_API_KEY"))
    .environment(Environment.PRODUCTION)
    .region(Region.INDONESIA)
    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    .retryPolicy(RetryPolicy.defaultPolicy())
    .enableRealTimeUpdates(true)
    .enableMetrics(true)
    .build()

// Initialize service clients
val rescueService = animaUnityClient.rescue()
val adoptionService = animaUnityClient.adoption()
val medicalService = animaUnityClient.medical()
val donationService = animaUnityClient.donation()
```

### First Integration - Emergency Rescue Report
Implement your first integration with the emergency rescue reporting system:

```kotlin
// Report an animal emergency with comprehensive details
val emergencyReport = rescueService.createEmergencyReport(
    EmergencyReportRequest.builder()
        .location(
            Coordinates.builder()
