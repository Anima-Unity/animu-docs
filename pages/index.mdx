## Project Overview

Anima Unity aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem for pet lovers, integrating pet management, veterinary services, and animal shelters into one seamless platform. Whether you're looking for pet care services, need to consult with a vet online, or want to adopt a pet from a shelter, Anima Unity provides all the tools to make these services accessible, efficient, and engaging.

The platform provides key features like:
- **AniBuddies**: A social network for pet lovers to connect, share experiences, and find new friends for their pets.
- **AniShop**: A marketplace for all pet-related products and services, including food, accessories, and more.
- **AniHealth**: A platform for online veterinary consultations, medical records, and health management for pets.
- **AniCare**: Pet grooming and boarding services.
- **AniFun**: Games and bonding activities for pets and their owners.
- **AniTrack**: GPS tracking for pets, ensuring their safety at all times.
- **AniShelter**: Supporting animal shelters by facilitating pet adoption and providing shelter resources.

The platform also supports community-driven initiatives for animal welfare, such as campaigns for stray animals and partnerships with shelters to improve pet adoption.
