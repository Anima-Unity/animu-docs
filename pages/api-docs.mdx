# Anima Unity API Documentation Blueprint

Anima Unity provides a powerful RESTful API to interact with the platform programmatically. This API allows developers to manage users, pets, veterinary services, products in the marketplace, and much more. Below, you'll find an overview of the API, authentication methods, available endpoints, and examples for using them.

## Authentication

Anima Unity uses **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication. To use the API, you must first obtain an access token. This token must be included in the headers of all requests that require authentication.

### How to Authenticate

1. **OAuth2.0 Flow**: You must register your application with the platform to receive a **client ID** and **client secret**.
2. **Token Request**: Use these credentials to request an access token from the authorization server.

   Example request to get a token:
   ```bash
   POST /oauth/token
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=your-client-id
   client_secret=your-client-secret
   grant_type=client_credentials
   ```

3. Access Token: The response will contain an access token that you can use to authenticate subsequent API requests.



Example response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-access-token",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

You can then include the access token in your API request headers:

Authorization: Bearer your-access-token
